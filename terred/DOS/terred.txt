                            TerrainEd v1.0

A commandline utility for creating a TERTYPES lump for the Eternity Engine

**************************************************************************

How to Use TerrainEd

After writing a script to the specifications below to define your
TerrainTypes, run TerrainEd as follows:

terred <scriptfile> <outfile>

where <scriptfile> is the name of the text file in which you saved your
script, and <outfile> is the name of the file to which you want to write 
your TERTYPES lump.

Example:

terred script.txt tertypes.lmp

After running the utility, you can use any WAD tool of your choice to
embed the output into a data lump named TERTYPES.

A WAD file may have any number of these lumps, but only the first will be
used. If multiple files with TERTYPES lumps are included in the game,
only the first one in the file last added will be used. TERTYPES lumps
are not accumulative.

for more information and for updates and new versions.

**** INPUT FORMAT ***

The input script for TerrainEd may consist of any number of lines less than
32768 of the following form: 

<flatname> = <typename> 

The = is optional, but there must be at least one space or tab character 
between the flatname and typename tokens. 

<flatname> is the name of any flat and may be up to 8 characters long. The 
flat does not have to be present in a wad when this lump is encountered -- 
types with flats that don't exist will be ignored by the game engine. 

<typename> may be the name of one valid TerrainType, which currently 
includes the following: 

FLOOR_SOLID - A placeholder type that causes no special terrain effects. 
Providing a string for <typename> that is invalid will additionally cause 
it to default to FLOOR_SOLID 

FLOOR_WATER - The water TerrainType. Flats with this type will cause two 
splash objects to appear and will play the DSSPLASH sound. 

FLOOR_LAVA - New to Eternity v3.29b3 - The lava TerrainType. Flats with 
this type will cause a fire splash to appear and smoke to rise up, and will 
play the DSBURN sound. 

FLOOR_SLUDGE - The swamp TerrainType. Flats with this type will cause two 
sludge splash objects to appear and will play the DSMUCK sound. (This type 
is not assigned by default to any flats in doom(2).wad, but IS used in 
Eternity TC. Feel free to make your own uses of it). 

More types will be introduced soon, including sewage, nukage, blood, and a
special scripted type to allow for completely customizable effects.
